## Scenario Gap Quest (SGQ)
It is a tool used to indetify the gaps between the problem and the actualy solution. We devide it into 3 columns : Stakeholders, Gap, Future(OUTCOME). Gap analysis helps in aligning the current status with the desired future state. By identifying gaps, we can develop strategic plans to bridge those gaps and achieve our goals effectively.

## Business actions and outcomes
Once we have identified the stakeholders, problem, and solution. The next step is to understand the impact of the solution and its feasibility.
How can the actions effect the business?
What are the outcomes?
Are some such questions one should ask themselves when ready to implement a solution, in this case a model.
