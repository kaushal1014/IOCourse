# Model testing Importance

## Performance Matirx 
- MAE : takes the average of absolute errors for a group of predictions and observations as a measurement of the magnitude of errors for the entire group.
- Mape : is the percentage equivalent of mean absolute error (MAE). Mean absolute percentage error measures the average magnitude of error produced by a model, or how far off predictions are on average. 
## What Is Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter.In hypothesis testing, an analyst tests a statistical sample, with the goal of providing evidence on the plausibility of the null hypothesis.

The 2 different hypotheses: 
- The null hypothesis : the assumption that the event will not occur
- The alternative hypothesis : the logical opposite of the null hypothesis

Thus, they are mutually exclusive,however, one of the two hypotheses will always be true.

## Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

An ARIMA model can be understood by outlining each of its components as follows:
- Autoregression (AR): refers to a model that shows a changing variable that regresses on its own lagged, or prior, values.
- Integrated (I): represents the differencing of raw observations to allow the time series to become stationary (i.e., data values are replaced by the difference between the data values and the previous values).
- Moving average (MA):  incorporates the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
