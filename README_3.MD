# Model testing Importance

## What Is Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter.In hypothesis testing, an analyst tests a statistical sample, with the goal of providing evidence on the plausibility of the null hypothesis.

The 2 different hypotheses: 
- The null hypothesis 
- The alternative hypothesis.
The Null Hypothesis is the assumption that the event will not occur.
The Alternate Hypothesis is the logical opposite of the null hypothesis.Thus, they are mutually exclusive, and only one can be true. \
However, one of the two hypotheses will always be true.

## Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

An ARIMA model can be understood by outlining each of its components as follows:
- Autoregression (AR): refers to a model that shows a changing variable that regresses on its own lagged, or prior, values.
- Integrated (I): represents the differencing of raw observations to allow the time series to become stationary (i.e., data values are replaced by the difference between the data values and the previous values).
- Moving average (MA):  incorporates the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
