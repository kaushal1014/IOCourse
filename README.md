# IOCourse
Decoding tomorrow: Timeseries forcasting


### What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.

During the initial classes of the IO course, I learnt the basics of python. The first assignment was a set of python codes to execute. It included dictionaries, lists, input handling, etc.

This later transitioned to introduction to Pandas, matplotlib, sklearn.
These are the base modules to perform data analysis in python.
